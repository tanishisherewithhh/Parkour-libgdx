# Parkour-libgdx
This is a sample 3D game made using libgdx (a java game development framework). The player is a capsule. As a test world, I put it in a small parkour map created by me.

It uses the bullet physics collision library.

Made for learning libgdx and bullet physics.

The assets used are not owned by me and I found them on google.

LibGDX: https://libgdx.com/

Bullet Physics wiki: https://libgdx.com/wiki/extensions/physics/bullet/bullet-physics

May turn into a proper game with levels, rewards, shop and new powerups
