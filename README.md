# Parkour-libgdx
This is a sample 3D game made using libgdx (a java game development framework). The player is a capsule. As a test world, I put it in a small parkour map created by me.
By no means is this complete and optimised.
It uses the bullet physics collision library.

Made for learning libgdx and bullet physics.

The assets used are not owned by me and I found them on google.

LibGDX: https://libgdx.com/

Bullet Physics wiki: https://libgdx.com/wiki/extensions/physics/bullet/bullet-physics

May turn into a proper game with levels, rewards, shop and new powerups

Controls:
Standard WASD for movement.
Press space for jump (triple jump at a time).
Press X for showing the XYZ axis above the capsule.
Press Left Control for the camera to remain pivoted while the player moves around.
Press K to enable the debug renderer of bullet. (Shows collision boxes).
Use mouse and scroll wheel to control the camera.
